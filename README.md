# AI.Kisan
AI.Kisan - Random Forest | Logistic Regression | Pandas | NumPy

AI.Kisan is an AI/ML-powered model designed to optimize agricultural practices by predicting the fertilizers needed for soil health and recommending the most suitable crops based on field attributes such as soil quality and weather conditions. The model leverages algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, employing feature selection to improve the accuracy and reliability of crop predictions, helping farmers make informed decisions that maximize productivity and sustainability.

The model's goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical agriculture knowledge and practical, data-driven solutions. By integrating environmental factors such as regional rainfall, temperature, soil pH, and nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), AI.Kisan creates a tailored solution for different crops. The dataset includes a wide range of crops, including rice, maize, chickpeas, kidney beans, pomegranate, mango, and cotton, offering robust insights into crop recommendations for varied environmental conditions.

In India, where agriculture is the backbone of the economy, farmers often struggle with uncertainties related to crop yields and soil management. With over 10,000 farmers committing suicide annually due to crop failure and financial stress, AI.Kisan can play a vital role in reducing these challenges. By accurately predicting the right fertilizers and crop types for specific conditions, this model can help farmers make data-driven decisions, potentially increasing crop yields and minimizing losses.

In addition to predicting crop yields, the system also uses real-time sensor data to provide instant recommendations, enabling farmers to act promptly on field conditions. This predictive power can significantly enhance yield forecasting, helping farmers plan better for surplus and market demands, which in turn can improve their economic stability.

The User Interface (UI) was designed with user-centric principles, ensuring easy navigation and accessibility. Through wireframing, the UI was structured to provide a seamless user experience with a visually appealing aesthetic. The system is responsive, adapting to different devices, ensuring uniform functionality across mobile and desktop platforms. Iterative usability testing was conducted, refining the interface based on user feedback for enhanced interaction and engagement.
